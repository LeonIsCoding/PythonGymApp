# PythonGymApp
## README
This application is a remake of another project called "East Surrey College Gym App" written in C#. I wanted to remake the application in Python 3.

### What's new with this version?
Nothing yet, this project is still early in development
### What's been easier?
Already knowing how the application functions and looks has speed up time.
The methods I have done have been easy to implement using Python.
The methods I wanted have been easy to pick up and learn.
### What's been harder?
Developing the UI using tkinter has been a challenge, it is much harder to use than using Visual Studio's Form Designer.
