# PythonGymApp
## README
This application is a remake of another project called "ESC Gym App" written in C#. I wanted to remake the application in Python 3.

[View original Project here](https://github.com/lovelyleon/East-Surrey-College-Gym-App)

### What's new with this version?
The v1.0 of the application aims to be a complete solution that can accomplish everything that "ESC Gym App" could do, some extensions were left in the original project that may be carried over after the version has been reached.
But as of right now, no new features will be developed until this project is a remake of the original C#
### What's been easier?
Already knowing how the application functions and looks has speed up time.
The methods I have done have been easy to implement using Python.
The methods I wanted have been easy to pick up and learn.
### What's been harder?
Developing the UI using tkinter has been a challenge, it is much harder to use than Visual Studio's Form Designer.
